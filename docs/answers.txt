    Reason 1: Allows multiple people to work in a project.
    Reason 2: Saves the program which can be accessed easily.

5:
    `git log` shows the history of commits in an order.
    While `git status` shows which files are, and aren't part of the staging
    phase, so that when there is a commit, it takes into account the changes
    on those files (those that are in the staging phase), and it wont take 
    into account those files that aren't part of the stagging phase

    I: Inheritance help to derive children classes from parent classes. The hierarchy of classes make it easier to
        share attributes and functions.

    II: Polymorphism allow to share one single method among different classes which each of them have their own outcome
        depending on the specifications.

    III: Encapsulation is joining data and methods (functions) that work on 
         on that data within one unit.

    The Dictator and Lieutenants Worfklow works on the basis that everyone
    pulls from the main repo, but to push it goes up through the hierarchy,
    first from the individuals, to the lieutenants, then from the lieutenants
    to the Dictator and then the dictator pushes to the main repo. While the
    Integration Manager workflow is a workflow in which every developer has 
    it/their own public repo which is a fork of the blessed repository, then
    the integration manager is charged with integrating all of the repos by
    the developers, and then he pushes to the blessed repository.

    The main difference is that the Dictator and Lieutenants have to pass 
    through the hierarch in order to push the blessed repo, while the
    integration manager is the only one with the task of gathering ALL the code
    and integrating in so that it's usable and then push it to the blessed repo

    100 developers would be better of with Dictator Lieutenant (D&L) Workflow since
    with the Centralized. In the Centralized Workflow everyone must always 
    have the most current version of the repo in order to push, and with 
    there being 100 developers it will be bound to have a lot of issues, 
    and overall very time consuming. While on the Dictator Lieutenant, they
    only worry of their own team code, and maybe even only on their own code, 
    while their lieutenants are the one that are worried of the working of it's
    team code, so that at the end the Dictator is the one that is incharge of
    uniting the code to make the software complete and so push a new version of
    it.
